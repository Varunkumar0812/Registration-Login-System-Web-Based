# Registration and Login System - Web based Application

A extended version of my previous mini-project of Registration and Login - Console based program.

Implements JDBC and follows MVC Architecture built using primitive Java Web Development Tools like JSPs and Servlets.

A fully dynamic website which has a connection with a database. To simulate the registration, logging in and forgot password feature.

The details of the database : MySQL DB

Structure of the database schema used :


| username        | first_name | last_name  | password                         | recovery_email | dob        | gender |
